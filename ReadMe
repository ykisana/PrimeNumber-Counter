This script prints out all numbers that are (probably) prime
It is an infinite loop, must be terminated to end

Checks for prime via Miller-Rabin primality test
The test is performed on each Natural Number after 2 as the count increases by one for each iteration of the loop

It starts as 3 as that is the first prime
